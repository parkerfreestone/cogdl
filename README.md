# Church of Gromp Dodgeball League

A dodgeball league simulation where users can register and manage their teams via a Discord bot, while games are simulated on a schedule. The project aims to include a REST API that handles team management, trades, and real-time game updates, as well as a Discord bot that allows interaction with the league directly through commands.

##Architecture

The project consists of two main components:

- **Discord Bot**: Acts as the interface for users to interact with the league, allowing team creation, trades, and notifications of game results.
- **API Backend**: Handles team management, game simulation, scheduling, and processes trades. It uses sqlite to persist data.
